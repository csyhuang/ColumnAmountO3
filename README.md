### [Webpage scrapping/Data retrival: ColumnAmountO3](https://github.com/csyhuang/ColumnAmountO3)

The python script *Aug7_2016_AutoRetrieval.py* in this repository (1) scrap the data file links, (2) downloading and (3) converting the satellite data (.he5) obtained by the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) into ascii files. October 2, 2015 was the day with annual maximum Antarctic ozone hole. 

*(Note: NASA has changed the data retrieval protocol and requires credentials for downloading after the [Rossbypalooza workshop](rossbypalooza.org), when the data was used. The script has to be updated to accommodate that.)*
